`@SpringBootApplication` is a convenience annotation that adds all of the following:

- `@Configuration`: Tags the class as a source of bean definitions for the application
context.
- `@EnableAutoConfiguration`: Tells Spring Boot to start adding beans based on classpath
settings, other beans, and various property settings. For example, if `spring-webmvc` is
on the classpath, this annotation flags the application as a web application and activates
key behaviors, such as setting up a `DispatcherServlet`.
- `@ComponentScan`: Tells Spring to look for other components, configurations, and
services in the `com/example` package, letting it find the controllers.

The `main()` method uses Spring Boot's `SpringApplication.run()` method to launch an
application. Did you notice that there was not a single line of XML? There is no `web.xml`
file, either. This web application is 100% pure Java and you did not have to deal with
configuring any plumbing or infrastructure.
